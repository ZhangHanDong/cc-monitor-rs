  - `--tui` - Launch in Terminal UI mode
  - `--gui` - Launch in GUI mode (default)
  - `--help` - Show help information
  - `--version` - Display version
- **Flexible Usage**:
  ```bash
  cc-monitor-rs --tui  # Terminal mode
  cc-monitor-rs        # GUI mode (default)
  ```

### Improved

#### üîß Stability Enhancements
